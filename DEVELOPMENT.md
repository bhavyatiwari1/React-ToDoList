## Testing Instructions

### Quick Start Testing
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Try adding a few tasks with different lengths and content
3. Mark some tasks as complete
4. Test all filter options (All, Active, Completed)
5. Test all sorting options (Newest, Oldest, Alphabetical)
6. Refresh the page to verify localStorage persistence

### Comprehensive Testing
See `src/components/__tests__/TodoList.test.md` for detailed testing checklist.

## Technical Architecture

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React useState hooks
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage API
- **Validation**: Custom validation functions
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications for user feedback

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient filtering and sorting with minimal re-renders
- localStorage operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Debounced input validation
- Optimized task list rendering with proper keys

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES2015+ support
- localStorage API support required
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support for layout
